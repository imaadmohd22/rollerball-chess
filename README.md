Rollerball Chess AI
This project is a simple Python program that lets you play a custom variant of chess called Rollerball Chess against an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to decide its moves.

About the Game
Rollerball Chess is played on a 5x6 board using only kings, rooks, knights, and pawns. Pawns can promote to a rook or knight when they reach the last rank. The game ends when a king is captured.

How to Play
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Clone this repository or download the project files.
Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run: python main.py
When prompted, enter moves in this format: e2e4. This moves the piece from e2 to e4.The AI will calculate and make its move automatically after yours.
